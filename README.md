## My process:

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Google Fonts (Figtree)

### What I learned:

This challenge helped me practice building:

- A responsive layout using Flexbox
- Clean semantic HTML structure
- Custom styled components like badges and avatars

### Continued development:

## In future projects, I‚Äôd like to:

Explore using CSS Grid alongside Flexbox

Practice accessibility (like keyboard navigation/focus states)

Improve animation and transitions for micro-interactions

### Useful resources:

MDN Web Docs ‚Äì My go-to for HTML/CSS documentation.
